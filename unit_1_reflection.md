# What worked well during unit 1?
Things that worked well in unit 1 were that I learned the basic coding skills in the Python language, and how to draw flow diagrams and system diagrams. I was also able to practice coding in Python with all the quizzes. In addition, I was able to create a complete text-based program for the first time.

# what did not work well?
I believe that I still need to work more on my time management for completing major tasks and projects. Also, it would be great if I could try to figure out how to deal with the quizzes in class so that I could have more time afterclass to dedicate to major assignments and projects.

# what did i enjoyed the most during project unit 1?
I enjoyed the process of tackling different tasks and coming up with solutions for different purposes I wanted my program to achieve. It is also enjoyable to learn how to add the colors and ASCII arts into the program's output to make it more interesting.

# What talent have you discovered or practiced during this unit?
I I have discovered my creativity in this unit for I was surprised that I was able to come up with different logics for programs that tackles different aims. 

# What is working well in Computer Science for you?
I believe that my self-development including what I have learned in terms of the language of Python, and computational thinking. I have also gained growth in problem solving skills and mindsets.

# What can Dr. Ruben do better to support you during Unit 2?
It would be very helpful that Dr. Ruben can continue teaching us skills for coding, while still maintaining the cultivation of our computational thinking. It would also be interesting if we are given the chance to do some personalized or collaborative projects.
